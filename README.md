## Architec ##
Here's a rough outline to get you started with a form-based input project:

Project: Disease Risk Calculator (Form-based input)

Backend:

    Use Python to create a RESTful API that takes in user input (e.g., age, BMI, family history)
    Calculate the disease risk using a simple algorithm or a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression)
    Return the calculated risk to the frontend

Frontend:

    Use Next.js to create a web page with a form that asks users for input
    Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple, responsive design
    Send the user input to the backend API and display the calculated disease risk to the user

Step 2: Create a Django Project

Navigate to your project directory and create a new Django project:

bash

cd C:\Users\Alex\Projects\medical
django-admin startproject disease_calculator

This command will create a new directory called disease_calculator with the necessary Django files.
Step 3: Create a Django App

Django projects consist of apps that handle different parts of your projectâ€™s functionality. Let's create an app for your disease risk calculation:

bash

cd disease_calculator
python manage.py startapp risk_calculator

Step 4: Define Your Model

Inside your app (risk_calculator), define models to store data like age, BMI, family history, etc. Open the models.py file and add a model for storing user inputs:

python

from django.db import models

class UserInput(models.Model):
    age = models.IntegerField()
    bmi = models.FloatField()
    family_history = models.BooleanField()  # True if there is a family history of the disease

Step 5: Register Your App and Model

In the settings.py file of your disease_calculator project, add your new app to the INSTALLED_APPS list:

python

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'risk_calculator',
]

Step 6: Migrate Your Database

Django uses migrations to manage changes to your database schema. Run the following commands to create and apply migrations for your new model:

bash

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Step 7: Create Views

In the views.py file of your risk_calculator app, create a view to handle the form data and calculate the disease risk:

python

from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import UserInput

def calculate_risk(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        age = request.POST.get('age')
        bmi = request.POST.get('bmi')
        family_history = request.POST.get('family_history') == 'on'
        
        # Placeholder for your risk calculation logic
        risk = "Low"  # Calculate based on input
        
        return render(request, 'result.html', {'risk': risk})

    return render(request, 'index.html')

Step 8: Configure URLs

In your app, create a urls.py file to define routes:

python

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.calculate_risk, name='calculate_risk'),
]

Step 9: Create Templates

Create templates for the user interface. Under the risk_calculator directory, create a new directory called templates, and inside, create index.html and result.html for the user inputs and results display.
Step 10: Run Your Server

Start your Django development server:

bash

python manage.py runserver

Now, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser to see your application in action.

This setup provides a foundational structure for your Django project. You can expand upon this by adding more features, refining your risk calculation algorithm, and enhancing the frontend.
